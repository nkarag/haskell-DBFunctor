## Introduction  
__[Julius](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/DBFunctor-0.1.0.0/docs/Etl-Julius.html)__ is a type-level *Embedded Domain Specific Language (EDSL)* for ETL data processing in Haskell.  Julius enables us to express complex data transformation flows (i.e., an arbitrary combination of ETL operations) in a more friendly manner (a __Julius Expression__), with plain Haskell code (no special language for ETL scripting required).
It is an "embedded" DSL because it "lives" within Haskell code and is compiled with GHC as usual. It is not a different language requiring some special compiler/interpreter to work. 
In fact, a *Julius Expression* is just a common Haskell data type. The whole syntax of the Julius language consists of nothing more than a series of Haskell data type definitions. These data types simply comprise the Julius language. A syntax error in the Julius language is just a data type construction error that can be caught by the compiler.
In this tutorial, we will show the basics of Julius in order to help someone to get started. (See also the documentation of the **Etl.Julius** and **RTable.Core** **modules** of the **DBFunctor package** for more details on the data types and functions exposed). 
<a  name="htr"></a>
## How to run
See [this](https://github.com/nkarag/haskell-DBFunctor/blob/master/README.md#howtorun).
<a  name="syntax"></a> 
## Julius Basic Syntax: The Julius Expression  
A *Julius Expression* is a sequence (i.e., a chain)  of individual *ETL Operations* connected with the `:->` constructor. Each such operation acts on one (Unary), or two (Binary) input `RTable`(s) and produces a new (immutable) `RTable`. 
So, *a Julius Expression is a means to define an arbitrary complex data transformation over RTables, consisting of an arbitrary number of processing steps (aka ETL Operations) . *
In its most basic form a Julius expression looks like this:

    EtlMapStart :-> <etl operation> :-> ... :-> <etl operation>

The `:->` connector is left associative because a Julius expression is evaluated from left to right (or from top to bottom). Essentially `:->` is a data constructor of the `ETLMappingExpr` data type , which receives two input parameters (check out the documentation of the Etl.Julius module in the DBFunctor package in Hackage - just google "Hackage Etl.Julius").
An "etl operation" can be either a *Relational Algebra Expression*, or a *Column Mapping* (i.e,. a column-level transformation). A Relational Algebra is a sequence of relational algebra operations acting on some input RTable(s). A Column Mapping is a transformation at the column-level where one or more new columns are created based on one or more existing ones. We explain both concepts in the following paragraphs. 
A Relational Algebra expression in Julius EDSL begins with an `EtlR $` notation (after "$" follow the relational algebra operations), while a column mapping begins with `EtlC $`. So, a Julius expression essentially looks like this:
```
EtlMapStart :-> (EtlX $ ...) :-> (EtlX $ ...) :-> ... (EtlX $ ...)
```
where 'X' in "EtlX" is  'C' ,or 'R'.
We will comeback to Julius expressions in more detail, but first lets see how can we create an RTable.
<a  name="tip"></a>
### A tip for working with Julius Syntax
The easiest way to work with the Julius DSL syntax, when writing code, is to have the haddock documentation of the Etl.Julius beside, in a browser window, and use it, in order to navigate back and forth between the several Julius clauses.
The path that the haddock documentation resides can be found by issuing a `stack haddock` command in  the DBFunctor project directory.

## Julius DDL: Creating an RTable from a CSV file
In order to create an RTable from your data (i.e., load your data into memory into the RTable data structure), you only need to call function `toRTable`:
```haskell
    toRTable :: (RTabular a) => RTableMData -> a -> RTable
```
`toRTable` is a method of the `RTabular` type class, which resides in the RTable. Core module of the DBFunctor package. So, if your data are loaded in a data type `a` , which is an instance of the `RTabular` type class, then the only thing you have to do, is to call `toRTable`, in order to get a new RTable loaded with your data. Of course `toRTable` also requires as input the necessary RTable metadata (`RTableMData`), which define the RTable's columns and corresponding data types (similar to an SQL `CREATE TABLE` DDL statement).

For example, assume we have a csv file "mydata.csv" with a data set that we want to convert into an RTable, in order to be able to process it with some Julius expression.
The first step is to read the csv file into some data type `a` that is an instance of the `RTabular` type class. In module, `RTable.Data.CSV` of the DBfunctor package, we have defined data type `CSV` to represent a CSV file and have made it an instance of `RTabular`. So the only thing you have to do is:
1. Read the csv file from disk into the CSV data type
2. Define the RTable metadata (i.e., its columns and corresponding data types) using function `createRTableMData` exported from the `Etl.Julius` module of the DBFunctor package.
```haskell
createRTableMData :: 
	(RTableName, [(ColumnName, ColumnDType)])	 
	-> [ColumnName]		--	Primary Key. [] if no PK exists
	-> [[ColumnName]]	--  list of unique keys. [] if no unique keys exists
	-> RTableMData
```
3. Use `toRTable` to convert the CSV into an RTable
These steps are depicted in the following code snippet.
```haskell
import     Etl.Julius
import     RTable.Data.CSV     (CSV, readCSV, writeCSV, toRTable)

main:: IO()
main = do
	-- 1. Read the csv file
	mycsv <- readCSV "mydata.csv"

	-- 3. Transform CSV data type into an RTable data type
	let myRTable = toRTable rtabMdata mycsv

	-- 4. Do stuff with your new RTable
	...
	where
		-- 2. Define the structure of the RTable
		rtabMData :: RTableMData
		rtabMData = createRTableMData (
			"myTab"  -- table name
			,[	("OWNER", Varchar)				-- Owner of the table
				,("TABLE_NAME", Varchar)		-- Name of the table
				,("TABLESPACE_NAME", Varchar)	-- Tablespace name
				,("STATUS",Varchar)				-- Status of the table object (VALID/IVALID)
				,("NUM_ROWS", Integer)			-- Number of rows in the table
				,("BLOCKS", Integer)			-- Number of Blocks allocated for this table
				,("LAST_ANALYZED", Timestamp "MM_DD_YYYY HH24:MI:SS")	-- Timestamp of the last time the table was analyzed (i.e., gathered statistics)
			]
		)
			["OWNER", "TABLE_NAME"] -- primary key
			[]	-- (alternative) unique keys	
```

## Working with Relational Algebra Operations
Relational Algebra is the algebra behind SQL. Any SQL statement is transformed behind the scenes into an algebraic expression consisting of one or more relational algebra operations that define how we want to process our data. Typical examples of such operations are: Selection (i.e., row filter), Projection, Inner-Join, Outer-Join, Aggregation, Grouping, Ordering, Union, Intersection, Difference etc. Relational algebra operations are applied to sets of tuples (aka relations). 
Julius EDSL supports all common relational algebra operations and applies them onto RTables, which are sets of RTuples. With Julius one can express an arbitrary complex data-processing-operation /query, combining an arbitrary number of relational operations. The means to achieve this is the *Relational Algebra Expression Clause* in a Julius expression, that as we discussed before, it always begins with an:`EtlR $`clause.
Lets see the syntax of a Relational Algebra Expression.
<a  name="rae"></a> 
### Relational Algebra Expressions
A relational algebra expression in Julius EDSL is a sequence of relational operation clauses connected with the `:.` connector.  The first operation is always `ROpStart`, which represents an "empty" operation and is there to signify the beginning of the expression. Of course as we have said before the expression must follow an `EtlR $` clause. Here is the typical structure of a relational algebra expression in Julius:
```haskell
EtlMapStart
        :-> (EtlR $
                ROpStart  
                :. (<relational operation 1>)
				:. (<relational operation 2>)
		
						...
		
				:. (<relational operation N>)
			)

```
Similar to the `:->` connector , `:.`  is left-associative (i.e., evaluated from left to right, or from top to bottom) with a higher precedence (infixl 6) than `:->` which is infixl 5.
<a  name="rao"></a> 
### Relational Algebra Operations
In this section we discuss the syntax of each relational algebra operation.

The syntax below appears in a BNF-like grammar, which is defined as follows:

Terminals are shown in normal font and nonterminals in "< >". A terminal might be a Julius keyword (e.g., "Filter"), or a Haskell data type (e.g., Text, or RTable, or RTuple -> Bool). Vertical bars | separate alternatives. Square brackets [ and ] indicate a Haskell list. Comments are enclosed between "(\*" and "\*)"
 

<a  name="selection"></a> 
#### SELECTION
**Meaning**: Filter RTuples of an RTable based on some RTuple-level predicate of type: 
```Haskell
type  RPredicate = RTuple -> Bool
```
**Input**: 
- RTable to apply the filter, 
- Predicate function

**Output**: A new (filtered) RTable

Syntax:
```
<Selection Operation>	::=	Filter <FromRTable> <ByPred>

<FromRTable>	::=	From <TabExpr>
<TabExpr>		::=	Tab <RTable> | Previous 	(* Specify the input RTable, or "Previous" if this operation is to be applied to a previous result, generated by the previous operation within the same expression *)
<RTable>		::= RTable

<ByPred>		::= FilterBy <RPredicate>
<RPredicate>	::= RTuple -> Bool		(* An RPredicate is simply a function of type RTuple -> Bool *)
```
Example:
```haskell
juliusToRTable $           
    EtlMapStart
    :-> (EtlR $
            ROpStart  
            :. (Filter (From $ Tab expenses) $ FilterBy myFpred))

myFpred :: RPredicate
myFpred = \t -> t <!> "category" == "FOOD:SUPER_MARKET" 
                && 
                t <!> "amount" > 50.00
```
SQL equivalent:
```SQL
SELECT * 
FROM expenses exp 
WHERE   exp.category = 'FOOD:SUPER_MARKET' 
        AND exp.amount > 50.00
```
Notes:
1. In order to access the value stored in a specific column in an RTuple, we can use the `<!>` function or the `<!!>` function. The former returns the value, while the latter returns the value wrapped within a Maybe, in the case that the column is not found. (Check out the documentation of the RTable.Core module of the DBFunctor package). Here are the corresponding signatures:
```haskell
(<!>)	:: RTuple -> ColumnName -> RDataType	
(<!!>)	:: RTuple -> ColumnName -> Maybe RDataType	

```
2. Function `juliusToRTable` evaluates a Julius expression and returns an RTable. We will discuss Julius expression evaluation later on.
<a  name="projection"></a> 
#### PROJECTION (SELECT)
**Meaning**: Column projection (i.e., select only the columns of interest)
**Input**: 
- Column names to be selected
- Input RTable to apply this operation
**Output**: A new (projected) RTable

Syntax:
```
<Projection Operation> ::=
					Select [<ColumnName>] <FromRTable>  (* This is a list of column names *)
					
<ColumnName>	::= Text

<FromRTable>	::=	From <TabExpr>
<TabExpr>		::= Tab <RTable> | Previous 	(* Specify the input RTable, or "Previous" if this operation is to be applied to a previous result, generated by the previous operation within the same expression *)
<RTable> 		::= RTable
```
Example:
```haskell
juliusToRTable $           
    EtlMapStart
    :-> (EtlR $
            ROpStart  
            :. (Filter (From $ Tab expenses) $ FilterBy myFpred)
            :. (Select ["TxTimeStamp", "Category","Description", "Amount"] $ From Previous))
```
SQL equivalent:
```SQL
SELECT "TxTimeStamp", "Category", "Description", "Amount" 
FROM expenses exp 
WHERE   exp.category = 'FOOD:SUPER_MARKET' 
        AND exp.amount > 50.00
```
Notes:
In the above example, we have applied a Projection operation (Select clause), right after a filtering operation (Filter clause). Note that in the SQL equivalent, the "*" in the SELECT clause from the previous example, has been replaced with a reference to specific columns.
<a  name="ij"></a> 
#### INNER JOIN
**Meaning**: An inner join operation between two RTables tries to pair the RTuples based on some join predicate of the type: 
```
type  RJoinPredicate = RTuple -> RTuple -> Bool
```
So this more generic than an "equi-Join", which is when then predicate involves only equality conditions between the columns of the two input RTables. In fact, it the equivalent to what is called a "theta-Join" in relational algebra. I.e., a Join operation where the "pairing condition" can be anything. Indeed, the join predicate is an arbitrary function between two RTuples of the input RTables that returns True, only when the input RTuples must be paired. 
**Input**: 
- Two Input RTables to be joined
- Join Predicate function

**Output**: A new (joined) RTable


Syntax:
```
<Inner Join Operation> ::=
						Join <TabLiteral> <TabExpr> <TabExprJoin>

<TabLiteral>		::= TabL <RTable>
<RTable>			::= RTable

<TabExpr>			::= Tab <RTable> | Previous 	(* Specify the input RTable, or "Previous" if this operation is to be applied to a previous result, generated by the previous operation within the same expression *)

<TabExprJoin>		::= JoinOn <RJoinPredicate>
<RJoinPredicate>	::= RTuple -> RTuple -> Bool
```
Example:
```haskell
juliusToRTable $           
    EtlMapStart
    :-> (EtlR $
            ROpStart  
            :. (Join (TabL expenses) (Tab categories) $ 
		            JoinOn (\tl tr -> tl <!> "category" == tr <!> "category")))
```
SQL equivalent:
```SQL
SELECT * 
FROM expenses exp JOIN categories cat 
		ON exp.category = cat.category
```
Notes:
- In the above example, we show a simple (equi) join between two RTables (namely expenses and categories).  The join condition is defined as a lambda expression. 
**Common Columns Naming Convention**
- In this example, we have not projected any columns, so all columns from both RTables are returned. Please note that for common column names between the two input RTables in the result of the join, we follow the convention: 
When we have two tuples t1 and t2 with a common column name (lets say "Common"), then the resulting tuple after a join will be "Common", "Common_1", so a "_1" suffix is appended. The tuple from the left table by convention retains the original column name. So "Column_1" is the column from the right table. If "Column_1" already exists, then "Column_2" is used.
<a  name="oj"></a> 
#### OUTER JOIN
**Meaning**:  Similar in concept with the Inner Join operation in that the goal is to "pair" the RTuples coming from the two input RTables. However, in the Outer Join operation, one of the two operand RTables is the "Preserving RTable". This means that all RTuples coming from the preserving RTable, will be preserved in the result. So the result will have the same number of RTuples as the preserving RTable. 

The result RTuple will have the columns from both RTables. The columns of the non-preserving RTable will have a value for those RTuples that have managed to be paired (i.e., satisfy the join condition) and a `Null` value for those that haven't.

When the preserving RTable is the left operand of the outer join, then we have a *Left Outer Join* operation. If it is the right operand, then we have a *Right Outer Join*. If both RTable operands are preserving, then we have a *Full Outer Join*.

Common columns appear in the result with the same naming convention as in the inner join operation (see above). However, in a Left Outer Join (and a Full Outer Join), the left RTable columns will retain their original name when there is a column name conflict, while in a Right Outer Join, it is the right RTable columns that will retain their original name.
**Input**: 
- Two Input RTables to be (outer) joined
- Join Predicate function

**Output**: A new (outer-joined) RTable


Syntax:
```
<Outer Join Operation> ::=
						LJoin <TabLiteral> <TabExpr> <TabExprJoin>
						|
						RJoin <TabLiteral> <TabExpr> <TabExprJoin>
						|
						FOJoin <TabLiteral> <TabExpr> <TabExprJoin>

<TabLiteral>		::= TabL <RTable>

<TabExpr>			::= Tab <RTable> | Previous 	(* Specify the input RTable, or "Previous" if this operation is to be applied to a previous result, generated by the previous operation within the same expression *)
<RTable>			::= RTable

<TabExprJoin>		::= JoinOn <RJoinPredicate>
<RJoinPredicate>	::= RTuple -> RTuple -> Bool
```
Example:
```haskell
juliusToRTable $           
    EtlMapStart
    :-> (EtlR $
            ROpStart  
            :. (LJoin (TabL expenses) (Tab categories) $ 
		            JoinOn (\tl tr -> tl <!> "category_id" == tr <!> "category_id")))

juliusToRTable $           
    EtlMapStart
    :-> (EtlR $
            ROpStart  
            :. (RJoin (TabL categories) (Tab expenses) $ 
		            JoinOn (\tl tr -> tl <!> "category_id" == tr <!> "category_id")))

```
SQL equivalent:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM expenses exp LEFT JOIN categories cat 
		ON exp.category_id = cat.category_id

SELECT * 
FROM categories exp RIGHT JOIN expenses cat 
		ON exp.category_id = cat.category_id

```
Notes:
- The above two queries are equivalent (i.e., return the same results) and just differ in the type of the outer join. In both queries the preserving RTable is the expenses. The query outer joins the expenses RTable with the categories RTable in an effort to get the category of an expense. However, since expenses is the preserving RTable, if an expense RTuple does not include a category, it will be preserved in the result.
<a  name="aggregation"></a> 
#### AGGREGATION
<a  name="saf"></a>
#### Standard Aggregation Functions 
**Meaning**:  The Aggregate operation is used when we want to apply an aggregate function (e.g., sum, average, min, max ,etc.) over the values of one or more columns of an RTable. It is important to understand that when we apply an aggregate operation to an RTable, then the resulting RTable is a single-RTuple RTable. The resulting RTuple includes only the aggregate-result columns and nothing more. 
**Input**: 
- A list of input columns to be aggregated and the aggregate function to be applied to each one, as well as the names of the new (aggregated) columns
- The input RTable over which the aggregation will be applied

**Output**: 
- A new (aggregated) RTable

Syntax:
```
<Aggregation Operation> ::=
						Agg <Aggregate>

<Aggregate>			::= AggOn [<AggOp>] <FromRTable>
<AggOp>				::=		Sum <ColumnName> <AsColumn>
						|	Count <ColumnName> <AsColumn>
						|	Min <ColumnName> <AsColumn>
						|	Max <ColumnName> <AsColumn>
						|	Avg <ColumnName> <AsColumn>
						|	StrAgg <ColumnName> <AsColumn> <Delimiter>	
						|   GenAgg <ColumnName> <AsColumn> <AggBy>
						
<AsColumn>			::= As <ColumnName>						
<ColumnName>		::= Text
<FromRTable>		::=	From <TabExpr>
<TabExpr>			::= Tab <RTable> | Previous 	(* Specify the input RTable, or "Previous" if this operation is to be applied to a previous result, generated by the previous operation within the same expression *)
<TabExpr>			::= Tab <RTable> | Previous 	(* Specify the input RTable, or "Previous" if this operation is to be applied to a previous result, generated by the previous operation within the same expression *)
<RTable>			::= RTable
<Delimiter>			::= String

<AggBy>				::= AggBy <AggFunction>
<AggFunction>		::= ColumnName -> RTable -> RDataType
```
Example:
```haskell
juliusToRTable $           
    EtlMapStart
    :->	(EtlR $
            ROpStart  
            :. (Agg $ 
			       AggOn [Sum "Amount" $ As "TotalAmount", Count "Tx_id" $ As "TxCount"] $ 
				       From $ Tab expenses
		       )
		)       
```
SQL equivalent:
```sql
SELECT sum("Amount") as "TotalAmount", count("Tx_id") as "TxCount" 
FROM expenses 
```
Notes:
- The `StrAgg` aggregate operation is a string aggregation (like `string_agg` in Postgresql, or `listagg` in Oracle). It aggregates the values of a text 'RDataType' column with a specified delimiter.
- In the query above we apply the two aggregate functions (sum and count) over the "Amount" and transaction_id ("Tx_id") columns respectively of the expenses RTable. The resulting RTable is a single-RTuple RTable with two columns, namely "TotalAmount" and "TxCount".
<a  name="ccaf"></a> 
#### Create Custom Aggregate Functions
In this subsection, we will use the `GenAgg` clause of the aggregation operator syntax discussed previously, to create a custom aggregate function. The `GenAgg` syntax is repeated here for convenience:
```
GenAgg <ColumnName> <AsColumn> <AggBy>

<AsColumn>			::= As <ColumnName>						
<ColumnName>		::= Text
<AggBy>				::= AggBy <AggFunction>
<AggFunction>		::= ColumnName -> RTable -> RDataType
```
We can see the type of an Aggregate Function:
```Haskell
type AggFunction = ColumnName -> RTable -> RDataType 
```
An aggregate function receives as input a source column (i.e., a `ColumnName`) of a source `RTable` and returns an aggregated value, which is the result of the aggregation on the values of the source column.
Here is an example of a custom aggregate function that implements the `string_agg` aggregate function (for Postrgresql fans) or `listagg` agg function for Oracle lovers ;-)
```Haskell
main :: IO()
main = do
    putStrLn "### CUSTOM Aggregation Example ###"
    putStrLn "Implement a custom listagg()"

    rtabResult <- runJulius $
        EtlMapStart
        :-> (EtlR $
                ROpStart
                :.  (GroupBy ["Name"] 
                        (AggOn [ Count "Name" $ As "CountName"
                   			-- 1. Here we call our custom agg function: myListAgg
		                        ,GenAgg "Name" (As "ListAggName") $ AggBy $ myListAgg (pack ";")]  $ 
	                        From $ Tab myrtab) $
                        GroupOn (\t1 t2 ->  t1!"Name" == t2!"Name"))
             )

    printRTable rtabResult
    where
    -- 2. Our custom listagg function. It must return an AggFunction data type
        myListAgg :: Text -> AggFunction
        myListAgg delimiter col rtab = 
	        -- 3. Fold over the input RTable and calculate aggregated value
            rdatatypeFoldr' ( \rtup accValue -> 
                if isNotNull (rtup <!> col)  && (isNotNull accValue)
                    then
                        rtup <!> col `rdtappend` (RText delimiter) `rdtappend` accValue
                    else                        
                        if isNull (rtup <!> col) && (isNotNull accValue)
                            then
                                accValue  -- ignore Null value
                            else                         
                                if isNotNull (rtup <!> col) && (isNull accValue)
                                    then
                                        case isText (rtup <!> col) of
                                            True ->  (rtup <!> col) 
                                            False -> Null
                                    else
                                        Null -- agg of Nulls is Null
                            )
                            Null
                            rtab

```
Here is the input RTable upon which our listagg aggregation will be applied:
```

In this example we have implemented a custom listagg /string_agg function. I.e., an aggregate function over the string values of a specific column. Essentially the function concatenates the string values of each group, separating them with a delimiter string  that we provide as input to the listagg function. 
From the output above, we can clearly see that we have grouped the input table by the "Name" column and have listagg-ed the same column. Also we have provided a count of the members of each group.
- Comment line 1.:  At this line,we call our custom aggregate function `myListAgg` using the `GenAgg` Julius clause.
-  Comment line 2.: Here we define our custom aggregate function. 
-  Comment line 3.:  Note the use of the `rdatatypeFoldr'` function of the RTable.Core module of the DBFunctor package. This is a fold over an input RTable that returns a single (RDataType) value. In our case this is the "string aggregated value".
<a  name="grouping"></a> 
#### GROUPING (GROUP BY)
**Meaning**:  The Grouping operation groups together RTuples based on a grouping predicate and than applies an aggregation operation (the same one) on each group separately. The aggregation operation, as we have seen from the previous paragraph, can include on or more aggregations on the input columns. The grouping predicate is an arbitrary function between two RTuples of the input RTables that returns True, only when the input RTuples should belong in the same group. The result is the set of aggregated RTuples (one RTuple corresponding to each group) consisting of the grouping columns as well as the aggregate-result columns.
**Input**: 
- The grouping columns from the input RTable
- The aggregation operation(s) to be applied
- The grouping predicate 
- The input RTable over which the grouping will be applied

**Output**: 
- A new (grouped) RTable

Syntax:
```
<Grouping Operation> ::=
				GroupBy [<ColumnName>] <Aggregate> <GroupOnPred>

<ColumnName>		::= Text

<Aggregate>			::= AggOn [<AggOp>] <FromRTable>
<AggOp>				::=		Sum <ColumnName> <AsColumn>
						|	Count <ColumnName> <AsColumn>
						|	Min <ColumnName> <AsColumn>
						|	Max <ColumnName> <AsColumn>
						|	Avg <ColumnName> <AsColumn>
						
<AsColumn>			::= As <ColumnName>						
<FromRTable>		::=	From <TabExpr>
<TabExpr>			::= Tab <RTable> | Previous 	(* Specify the input RTable, or "Previous" if this operation is to be applied to a previous result, generated by the previous operation within the same expression *)
<RTable>			::= RTable

<GroupOnPred>		::= GroupOn <RGroupPredicate>
<RGroupPredicate>	::= RTuple -> RTuple -> Bool

```
Example:
```haskell
juliusToRTable $           
    EtlMapStart
    :-> (EtlR $
            ROpStart  
            :. (GroupBy ["Category"]  
                        (AggOn [Sum "Amount" $ As "TotalAmount"] (From $ Tab expenses)) $ 
                        GroupOn  (t1 t2 -> t1 <!> "Category" == t2 <!> "Category") 
                )
		)      
```
SQL equivalent:
```sql
SELECT "Category",  sum("Amount") AS "TotalAmount"
FROM expenses exp 
GROUP BY  "Category" 
```
Notes:
- In the query above we group the expenses RTable on the "Category" column. The grouping predicate between two RTuples t1 and t2 is an equality condition on the "Category" column value. Additionally we have a single aggregation operation, namely a sum over the "Amount" column. The resulting RTable has an RTuple of two columns for each category: the category name and the summed expenses amount for this category.
 - In conformance with SQL semantics if we provide an empty list `[]` of `AggOp`s, then we will get back only the columns in the `GroupBy` clause and the result will consist of a single RTuple per group. It is equivalent to a `SELECT DISTINCT [column,...]` clause in SQL.
<a  name="agdc"></a> 
#### Aggregation & Grouping on a Derived Column
There are cases where we need to apply an aggregation or a grouping operation on a column-level expression. For example, we might want to sum the product of two columns, or we have a date column and we want to group by month (i.e., a truncated date at the month level), etc. 

Julius EDSL supports all these cases, but since column-level expression is essentially a *derived column*, we need to precede the aggregation or grouping operation in our Julius expression, with  a *Column Mapping* clause, in order to create the derived column on which the aggregation or grouping will be applied.
We will discuss Column Mapping next, after the Relational Algebra operations and there we can see a such an example. 
<a  name="so"></a> 
#### Set Operations
**Meaning**:  RTables conceptually are (or should be[^1]) sets of RTuples. Therefore, it is only natural to support set operations over RTables such as Union, Intersection and Difference of sets. By definition a set does not include duplicates. Therefore, when we Union two RTables, the RTuples of the left RTable, are removed from the right RTable in the result, but if the left (or right) RTable contains duplicate RTuples, so will the result.

[^1]: It is known that the implementation of Relational Tables in commercial RDBMSs diverges from the theoretic definition of the relation, being a set of tuples. For example, a relational table might include duplicate rows, which is something not allowed in a set. Also, a relational table can be ordered, while in a set there is no notion of ordering between the set elements. Our implementation of the `RTable` is similar to the Relational Table found in an RDBMS.
**Input**: 
- Two Input RTables to apply a set operation

**Output**: A new  RTable (the result of the set operation)

Syntax:
```
<Set Operation> ::=
						<TabLiteral> `Union` <TabExpr>
						|
						<TabLiteral> `Intersect` <TabExpr>	
						|
						<TabLiteral> `Minus` <TabExpr>
						|
						<TabLiteral> `MinusP` <TabExpr>

<TabLiteral>		::= TabL <RTable>

<TabExpr>			::= Tab <RTable> | Previous 	(* Specify the input RTable, or "Previous" if this operation is to be applied to a previous result, generated by the previous operation within the same expression *)
<RTable>			::= RTable
```
Example:
```haskell
juliusToRTable $           
    EtlMapStart
    :-> (EtlR $
            ROpStart  
	            -- 1. A Filter operation on expenses
			:. (Filter (From $ Tab expenses) $ FilterBy getJulyExpenses)
							
				-- 2. A Union of the previous result with revenues RTable
            :. (Union (TabL revenues) $ Previous)
		)
```
SQL equivalent:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM expenses
WHERE
	<getJulyExpenses predicate>
UNION
SELECT *
from revenues
```
Notes:
- We show a simple Union operation between two RTables: expenses and revenues. We assume that both of these RTables have an identical RTuple structure (i.e., the same column names and data types). 
- The expenses RTable is first filtered by some "getJulyExpenses" `RPredicate`. The Union operation's right operand is the result of this filter operation, which is denoted by the `Previous` keyword.

## Beyond Relational Algebra
Julius EDSL goes beyond the standard relational algebra operations. For example, in a set, we cannot define any ordering on its elements. So, in standard relational algebra there is no sorting operation defined. However, in real life, the ORDER BY clause is one of the most commonly used clauses in SQL, because we indeed need to sort the results of our queries. To this end, Julius supports "ORDER BY", as we will see next. Moreover, Julius supports the notion of a *generic unary/binary relational operation*, where one can provide an arbitrary function for implementing it. Sky is the limit, with generic relational operations, as one can use any function, as long as the function signature is respected. We will show next examples of such custom functions such as:
	- Adding a surrogate key column
	- Insert/append-ing RTuples in an RTable and
	- Doing a Group By with no aggregation
<a  name="ordering"></a> 
### ORDERING (ORDER BY)
**Meaning**:  The Julius Ordering clause is very similar to the SQL ORDER BY clause. You specify a list of columns based on which the input RTable will be sorted. The leftmost column in the list, takes the highest priority in the ordering and the rightmost the lowest. Each column can be separately ordered in ascending, or descending order. One difference with SQL ORDER BY is that we must explicitly specify the ordering type (ascending or descending), because there is no default.
**Input**: 
- A list of (column names, ordering specification - ascending/descending) pairs that defines the sorting of the input RTable
- The input RTable to be sorted

**Output**: A new (sorted) RTable (the result of ordering operation)
Syntax:
```
<Ordering Operation> ::=
		OrderBy [(<ColumnName>, <OrderingSpec>)] <FromRTable>

<ColumnName> 	::= Text

<OrderingSpec>	::= Asc | Desc

<FromRTable>	::=	From <TabExpr>
<TabExpr>		::= Tab <RTable> | Previous 	(* Specify the input RTable, or "Previous" if this operation is to be applied to a previous result, generated by the previous operation within the same expression *)
<RTable>		::= RTable

```
Example:
```haskell
juliusToRTable $           
    EtlMapStart
    :-> (EtlR $
            ROpStart  	     
			:. (OrderBy [("Category", Asc),("TxDate",Desc)] $ 
					From $ Tab expenses)
		)
```
SQL equivalent:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM expenses
ORDER BY "Category", "TxDate" desc
```
Notes:
- In this example, we have sorted the expenses RTable based on the "Category" column in ascending order and then, by "TxDate" values in descending order.

<a  name="roaf"></a> 
### Generic RTable Operations as Functions
**Meaning**:  Functionally speaking, an RTable operation is nothing more than a function from an RTable to an RTable, i.e., of the type: `RTable -> RTable`. To be more precise, this defines a *unary* RTable operation. Similarly, if we are talking about a *binary* RTable operation (e.g., a Join), then this is nothing more than a function of two parameters of the type: 
`RTable -> RTable -> RTable`. 
In order, to accommodate in Julius EDSL the ability to define an arbitrary function over RTables, as an RTable operation to be evaluated within a Julius expression (together with the standard relational operations that we have already discussed), we have provided two special clauses, in order to define a *generic unary (or binary) RTable operation*.
**Input**: 
- The function (or lambda expression) that defines the RTable operation 
- The input RTable(s) 

**Output**: A new RTable (the result of the application of the function)
Syntax:
```
<Generic RTable Operation> ::=
							GenUnaryOp <OnRTable> <ByGenUnaryOperation>
							|
							GenBinaryOp <TabLiteral> <TabExpr> <ByGenBinaryOperation>

<OnRTable>				::=	On <TabExpr>
<TabExpr>				::= Tab <RTable> | Previous 	(* Specify the input RTable, or "Previous" if this operation is to be applied to a previous result, generated by the previous operation within the same expression *)
<RTable>				::= RTable

<ByGenUnaryOperation>	::= ByUnaryOp <UnaryRTableOperation>
<UnaryRTableOperation>	::= RTable -> RTable

<TabLiteral>			::= TabL <RTable>
<ByGenBinaryOperation>	::= ByBinaryOp <BinaryRTableOperation>
<BinaryRTableOperation>	::= RTable -> RTable -> RTable
```
Three examples follow
<a  name="askc"></a> 
#### Add a surrogate key column and assign values to it 
```haskell
-- 1.
juliusToRTable $           
    EtlMapStart
    :-> (EtlR $
            ROpStart  	     
			:. (GenUnaryOp (On $ Tab expenses) $ 
						ByUnaryOp (addSurrogateKeyJ "TxSK" 0))
		)

```
SQL equivalent:
```sql
-- 1.
CREATE TABLE expenses_new AS
	SELECT (rownum - 1) as "TxSK", t.*
	FROM expenses t
```
Notes:
- In the first example, we use function `addSurrogateKeyJ` from the Etl.Julius module of the DBFunctor package, as a generic unary RTable operation. This function adds a new column (a surrogate key column) to the input RTable and then assigns values (a monotonically increasing integer value) starting off from an initial value (in our case the initial value is 0). Here is the signature of the  `addSurrogateKeyJ` function
```haskell
addSurrogateKeyJ :: Integral a     
				=> ColumnName    	-- ^ The name of the surrogate key column
				-> a            -- ^ The initial value of the Surrogate Key
				-> RTable       -- ^ Input RTable
				-> RTable       -- ^ Output RTable
```
<a  name="adr"></a> 
####  Append a delta RTable to a target RTable
```Haskell
-- 2.
juliusToRTable $           
    EtlMapStart
    :-> (EtlR $
            ROpStart  	     
			:. (GenBinaryOp (TabL rtabTarget) (Tab $ deltaTabFinal) $ 
					ByBinaryOp appendRTableJ)
		)
```
SQL equivalent:
```sql
-- 2.
INSERT /*+ append */ INTO rtabTarget
	SELECT * FROM deltaTabFinal
```
Notes:
- In the second example, we use function `appendRTableJ` from the Etl.Julius module of the DBFunctor package, as a generic binary RTable operation. This function appends the RTuples of an RTable to a target RTable. In our example, we assume that we have an RTable containing a daily delta (deltaTabFinal) and we append it to a target RTable (rtabTarget). Here is the signature of the `appendRTableJ` function.
```haskell
appendRTableJ ::
				RTable		-- ^ Target RTable
			->  RTable 		-- ^ Input RTable
			->  RTable 		-- ^ Output RTable
```
<a  name="dgb"></a> 
#### Doing a Group By with no aggregation
 I.e., the result RTable will have the same number of RTuples and columns as the source RTable, however its RTuples will be grouped together based on some input grouping predicate. This is different than a `GroupBy` clause with an empty list of `AggOp`s, which is mentioned above and corresponds to a `SELECT DISTINCT [column,...]` SQL clause.
```haskell
-- 3.
juliusToRTable $           
    EtlMapStart
    :-> (EtlR $
            ROpStart  	     
			:. (GenUnaryOp (On $ Tab expenses) $ 
						ByUnaryOp (groupNoAgg
										(t1 t2 -> t1 <!> "Category" == t2 <!> "Category")
										["Category"]
						)
				)
		)
```
SQL equivalent:
```sql
-- 3.
-- There is no grouping that returns the initial set of 
-- RTuples (i.e., same granularity with the source table) in SQL. 
-- (analytic functions do this but require also an aggregate function to be provided)
```
Notes:
-  In the third example, we use function `groupNoAgg` from the RTable.Core module (but also exported from Etl.Julius), as a generic unary operation. This function groups the RTuples of the source RTable based on some input grouping predicate. In our case, we group two RTuples when they belong to the same expense category. The resulting RTable will have exactly the same number of RTuples and columns with the source RTable (expenses), as no aggregation takes place.
```Haskell
groupNoAgg :: 
       RGroupPredicate   -- ^ Grouping predicate, in order to form the groups of 'RTuple's (it defines when two 'RTuple's should be included in the same group)
    -> [ColumnName]      -- ^ List of grouping column names (GROUP BY clause in SQL)
                         --   We assume that all 'RTuple's in the same group have the same value in these columns
    -> RTable            -- ^ input 'RTable'
    -> RTable            -- ^ output 'RTable'
```
- There is also `groupNoAggList` function that returns each group of RTuples, as a separate RTable element of a list:
```Haskell
groupNoAggList :: 
       RGroupPredicate   -- ^ Grouping predicate, in order to form the groups of 'RTuple's (it defines when two 'RTuple's should be included in the same group)
    -> [ColumnName]      -- ^ List of grouping column names (GROUP BY clause in SQL)
                         --   We assume that all RTuples in the same group have the same value in these columns
    -> RTable            -- ^ input 'RTable'
    -> [RTable]          -- ^ output list of 'RTable's where each one corresponds to a group

```

## ETL in Haskell and Julius EDSL
<a name="colmap"></a>
### Column Transformations: The Column Mapping Clause
**Meaning**:  A Column Mapping is the main ETL/ELT construct for defining *a column-level transformation*. Essentially with a Column Mapping, we can create one or more new (aka derived) column(s) , based on an arbitrary transformation function that maps a set of input columns (_Source Columns_) to a set of output columns (_Target Columns_):
`type ColXForm = [RDataType] -> [RDataType]`
(Note: `RDataType` is the standard data type  of a column in an RTuple (essentially a sum type acting as a wrapper for all common column data types), as it is defined in module RTable.Core of package DBFunctor)
So, in general with a column mapping we can express any NxM column transformation, where
1 ≤ N ≤ #source-columns and M ≥ 1. 
**Input**: 
- A list of source columns
- A list of target columns
- The input RTable 
- The column-level transformation to take place
When we want to implement a NxM column mapping, we need to provide a column transformation function (or lambda expression) of type `ColXForm`, with an input list of N elements and an output list of M elements. Each element in the input list corresponds one-to-one, to the corresponding element in the source columns list. Similarly, each element in the output list, corresponds  one-to-one, to the corresponding element in target columns list.
- An indicator of whether the source columns will be retained or removed in the output RTable
- An optional RTuple-level predicate, in order to apply a filter in the output RTable

**Output**: A new RTable (the result of the column transformation). The output RTable will include the target columns with values based on the column transformation function. 
The source columns will be included only if the `DontRemoveSrc`keyword was specified in the column mapping. 
If a target-column has the same name with a source-column and a `DontRemoveSrc` has been specified, then the (target-column, target-value) key-value pair, *overwrites* the corresponding (source-column, source-value) key-value pair (we cant have the same column name in two columns in the same RTuple).

Syntax:
```
<Column Mapping> ::=
							Source [<ColumnName>] <ToColumn>

<ColumnName>			::= Text

<ToColumn>				::= Target [<ColumnName>] <ByFunction>

<ByFunction>			::= By <ColXForm> <OnRTable> <RemoveSrcCol> <ByPred>
<ColXForm>				::= [RDataType] -> [RDataType]
<OnRTable>				::=	On <TabExpr>
<TabExpr>				::= Tab <RTable> | Previous 	(* Specify the input RTable, or "Previous" if this operation is to be applied to a previous result, generated by the previous operation within the same expression *)
<RTable>				::= RTable
<RemoveSrcCol>			::= RemoveSrc | DontRemoveSrc	
<ByPred>				::= FilterBy <RPredicate>
<RPredicate>			::= RTuple -> Bool
```
Example 1: Create a timestamp and a date column (target columns) from a text column (source column)

In this example, we use a single source column ("Date"), which stores date values in a Text format (`RText` data constructor of the `RDataType` data type). We want to use this column and create two new (derived) columns, namely "TxTimeStamp" and "TxDate", that will convert the source date value into a timestamp (truncated at 00:00:00 time) and date data type respectively. 
To this end, we provide a column transformation function ("dateTransformation") that converts the text value into a timestamp and a date, using the `RTime` and `RDate` data constructors of the `RDataType` data type of the RTable.Core module of the DBFunctor package.
In addition, we specify (by the keyword `RemoveSrc`) that the source column should be removed from the result RTable and that the result RTable, will include all source RTuples (since the `FilterBy` clause includes a predicate that returns always True).
```haskell
juliusToRTable $           
	EtlMapStart
	    :-> (EtlC $
	            Source ["Date"] $ 
	            Target ["TxTimeStamp", "TxDate"] $ 
	            By dateTransformation (On $ Tab mytab) RemoveSrc $
	            FilterBy (\_ -> True)
	        )
	    where
			dateTransformation = 
			    \[(RText dt)] -> let
			                            txtimestamp = RTime {rtime = createRTimeStamp  "DD/MM/YYYY HH24:MI:SS" (Data.Text.unpack (dt `Data.Text.append` " " `Data.Text.append` "00:00:00"))}
			                            txdate = RDate {rdate = dt, dtformat = "DD/MM/YYYY"}
			                     in [txtimestamp,txdate]
```
Example 2: Create a derived (target) column "Margin" from two source columns, namely "Revenue" and "Cost". In the result RTable, we keep both of the source columns (`DontRemoveSrc`) and we don't filter any RTuples.
```haskell
juliusToRTable $           
	EtlMapStart
	    :-> (EtlC $

	            FilterBy (\_ -> True)

### Julius Expressions and the ubiquitous ETL Mapping 
A Julius Expression defines a sequence of data processing steps (aka "ETL logic"), applied to one or more *source RTables*, in order to produce a new RTable, called the *target RTable*, which is the outcome of all these processing steps. So if we would like to abstract the pattern that we follow in a Julius expression, then this is the following:
```
[Source RTables] -> <ETL logic> -> Target RTable
```
The "ETL logic" is embedded in the Julius expression. It is the logic by which, we transform the source RTable(s) into the target RTable. So, one can say that: 

*A Julius expression embeds the data transformation logic (aka ETL logic) that when applied to a set of Source RTables,  produces a new RTable, called the Target RTable* 

I don't know if this sounds familiar to you, but this is exactly the definition of the *ETL Mapping* (or *Data Mapping*) concept, which is a construct ubiquitous to all contemporary ETL tools. 

Essentially, an ETL mapping is the data mapping unit, by which we implement the logic for loading/creating a single (target) table from one or more source tables. This table does not need to be a "final" table in our data processing pipeline. It can very well be some intermediate staging table, where we need to temporarily store some results that we will use in a later data processing step. In real-life Data Warehouses, a typical ETL flow might include hundreds or thousands of individual ETL mappings.

*Therefore a Julius expression is "the Haskell equivalent" to an ETL mapping, or more mathematically stated, we can say that the set of Julius Expressions and the set of ETL mappings are isomorphic (i.e., there is a one-to-one correspondence between them)* and we can write: 
```
Julius Expression ≌ ETL Mapping
```
That is the reason that the Haskell data type of the Julius Expression is named `ETLMappingExpr`.

### Evaluating a Julius Expression
From the previous section, we have seen in order to produce a target RTable, we need to apply some ETL logic to one or more source RTables:
```
[Source RTables] -> <ETL logic> -> Target RTable
```
Since the Julius expression embeds the ETL logic but also the source RTables, which appear in every relational operation or column mapping (as we have seen in the examples above), then we can write:
```
([Source RTables] -> <ETL logic>) -> Target RTable =
Julius Expression -> Target RTable
```
Indeed, each Julius expression corresponds to one and only one target RTable and thus there is a clear mapping of the form:
```
 Julius Expression -> RTable
```
Of course, many different Julius expressions might evaluate to the same target RTable, just as many different SQL statements might produce the same results. In fact, the "SQL equivalent" to this function is a `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` (CTAS) DDL statement.

In order to execute the ETL logic and produce the target RTable, we need to *evaluate* the Julius expression. More technically speaking, since the Haskell data type of a Julius expression is the `ETLMappingExpr`, then this evaluation function must be a function of the type: 
```
ETLMappingExpr -> RTable
```
Indeed, the core Julius expression evaluation function, which is defined in the module Etl.Julius of the DBFunctor package is:
```haskell
juliusToRTable :: ETLMappingExpr -> RTable
```
We have used this function in all of our examples above.

*The evaluation of a Julius expression (i.e., a `ETLMappingExpr`) to an `RTable` is strict*. It evaluates fully to [Normal Form (NF)](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2017/09/all-about-strictness) as opposed to lazy evaluation (i.e., only during IO), or evaluation to a [WHNF](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2017/09/all-about-strictness). This is for efficiency reasons (e.g., avoid space leaks and excessive memory usage). It also has the impact that exceptions will be thrown at the same line of code that `juliusToRTable` is called. Thus one should wrap this call with a [`catch` handler](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.10.1.0/docs/Control-Exception.html#g:5), as in the following example, in order to handle the exception gracefully.
Example:
```
do 
 catch (printRTable $ juliusToRTable $ <a Julius expression>)
       (\e -> putStrLn $ "There was an error in the Julius evaluation: " ++ (show (e::SomeException)) )
```
In this example, we are using function `printRTable`, of the Etl.Julius module in the DBFunctor package, in order to print on the screen the target RTable (i.e., the result of the Julius expression evaluation). We will discuss printing of RTables in a later section. Similarly we could use function `eitherPrintRTable`, that returns an `Either` data type wrapping the exception in the `Left` part, as follows:
```
do 
 p <- (eitherPrintRTable  printRTable $
	                          juliusToRTable $ <a Julius expression>                                 
      ) :: IO (Either SomeException ())
 case p of
           Left exc -> putStrLn $ "There was an error in the Julius evaluation: " ++ (show exc)
           Right _  -> return ()
```
There is a handful of other functions for evaluating a Julius expression, like `runJulius` and `eitherRunJulius`, which evaluate a Julius expression within an IO Monad, or `juliusToResult` and the corresponding `runJuliusToResult` and `eitherRunJuliusToResult`, which return the target `RTable` along with the number of `RTuple`s returned, all wrapped in a `RTabResult` data type; we urge the interested reader to find more details and examples in the documentation of the Etl.Julius module.

### Writing ETL Code in Haskell and Julius EDSL
We have seen that *behind each target RTable lies a Julius expression* that embeds the "logic" of how to generate it. This is important to remember, because when we want to write our ETL code in Haskell and Julius EDSL, then we should follow this simple rule:

__*Simple Guiding Rule 1*__
_Each target RTable that must be created[^2] based on some ETL logic, can be replaced with a_ `juliusToRTable <julius expresssion>` _expression._

[^2]:	We say "created" instead of "loaded", because since Haskell is immutable, the evaluation of a Julius expression, always results into a new RTable.


Lets see how beautiful ETL code we can write in Haskell. Lets assume the following ETL Source-to-Target Design:

|Data Sources		|ETL Design										|	Target Schema
|:---							|:---														|:---
|srcTab1, srcTab2	|[srcTab1] -> etl1								| -> trgTab1
| 								|[trgTab1, srcTab2] -> etl2					| -> trgTab2	
|								|[srcTab1, trgTab1, trgTab2] -> etl3	| -> trgTab3


At the right end, we see three target RTables (trgTab1, trgTab2, trgTab3). These should be the output  of our ETL code. In order to create each one of these, we need to run some "etl-logic code", etl1, etl2 and etl3 respectively. 
Each etl code might require as input one of the source RTables (srcTab1, srcTab2) and/or some of the target RTables (trgTab1, trgTab2, trgTab3). The exact dependencies for each etl code, appear in the middle column named "ETL Design".
In the following diagram, we depict the dependencies for each one of the three target RTables as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

![target_rtab_dependencies](./etl_code_example1.jpg)
Fig 1. Dependencies for creating the target RTables (aka ETL Design DAG).

Now, if we follow Rule 1 from above, we can substitute each target RTable with an equivalent Julius expression. So we can do this:
```haskell
trgTab1 = juliusToRTable julius1
trgTab2 = juliusToRTable julius2
trgTab3 = juliusToRTable julius3
```  
where julius1, julius2 and julius3 are the corresponding Julius expressions behind each target RTable. Remember that: *each Julius expression is essentially (input RTables + ETL logic)*. The necessary input RTables for each Julius expression, are clearly stated in the middle column named "ETL Design", in the table above, but also can be seen in Fig 1.
The next step is to order the evaluation of the Julius expressions, in such a way that the input RTable requirements of each one are met. This can be depicted in Fig. 2.

![julius_ordering](./etl_code_example2.jpg)
Fig 2. Evaluation order of Julius expressions according to input RTable requirements

In Fig 2, we can see that each target RTable is created by the evaluation of a specific Julius expression (denoted by a bold black arrow). At the bottom of the figure, we can see the evaluation order of the three Julius expressions. First we evaluate julius1, since its input requirements are just a source RTable and has no dependency to other Julius expression evaluations. Then, we proceed with julius2, which requires the result of the evaluation of julius1. Finally, we evaluate julius3, which requires both the evaluation of the other two.

Now  we can state our second guiding rule for writing ETL code in Haskell and Julius:

__*Simple Guiding Rule 2*__
_Order the evaluation of the Julius expressions based on their input RTable requirements._

Lets write our Haskell ETL function that implements the ETL design of our running example:
```haskell
import Etl.Julius

myEtl :: [RTable] -> [RTable]
myEtl [srcTab1, srcTab2] = 
	let
-- 1. Substitute each target RTable with the corresponding Julius expression
-- 2. Order the evaluation of the Julius expressions based on their input RTable requirements
		trgTab1 = juliusToRTable $ julius1 srcTab1
		trgTab2 = juliusToRTable $ julius2 trgTab1 srcTab2
		trgTab3 = juliusToRTable $ julius3 trgTab1 trgTab2 srcTab1	
	in [trgTab1,trgTab2,trgTab3]
	where
		julius1 :: RTable -> ETLMappingExpr
		julius1 = undefined

		julius2 :: RTable -> RTable -> ETLMappingExpr
		julius2 = undefined

		julius3 :: RTable -> RTable -> RTable -> ETLMappingExpr
		julius3 = undefined
```
We can clearly see the substitution of each target RTable with the corresponding Julius expression, as well as the ordering of the evaluation of the Julius expressions based on their input RTable dependencies.

Now that we have implemented our "ETL-logic" function, lets see how easy it is to run it with the `runETL` function of the Etl.Julius module. The following `main` function could be the top level function of our ETL program written in Haskell and the Julius EDSL. Is consists of three discrete steps:
 1. The **Extract** phase, where we read our data sources (some CSVs file in our case) and turn them into source RTables.
 2. The **Transform** phase, where we run our ETL-logic code in order to produce the target RTables from the source RTables. All the ETL-logic code is embedded in the `myETL` function, which we execute with the `runETL` function and providing the appropriate source RTables.
 3. Finally, the **Load** phase, where we save our target RTables to our target schema (in our case the target schema is just 3 csv files residing in the local file system) 

We recommend that you follow this 3-phase pattern in all of your ETL programs.
```Haskell
import Etl.Julius
import RTable.Data.CSV  (readCSV,  writeCSV,  toRTable, fromRTable)

main::IO ()
main = do
	-- 1. Read source RTables
	srcTab1csv  <-  readCSV  "srcTab1.csv"
	srcTab2csv  <-  readCSV  "srcTab2.csv"
	let
		srcTab1 = toRTable srcTab1MData srcTab1csv
		srcTab2 = toRTable srcTab2MData srcTab2csv

	-- 2. Run you ETL-logic code to produce target RTables
	[trgTab1,trgTab2,trgTab3] <- runEtl myEtl [srcTab1,srcTab2]

	-- 3. Save Results into 3 CSV files - one for each target RTable
	writeCSV "trgTab1.csv" $ fromRTable trgTab1MData trgTab1
	writeCSV "trgTab2.csv" $ fromRTable trgTab2MData trgTab2
	writeCSV "trgTab3.csv" $ fromRTable trgTab3MData trgTab3

```

## Complex Queries as Julius Expressions
In the following paragraphs, we will discuss some more advanced use-cases of the Julius EDSL. We will begin with an example of a monthly running total, that would require some more advanced SQL to be calculated and then proceed to show how we can define subqueries in Julius, as well as "named subqueries" that can be referenced through out our Julius expression, or even in a separate expression. 
<a name="rtotal"></a>
### Implementing a Monthly Running Total
What we want to achieve is quite simple: 
Assume we have a table that includes monthly totals. Lets say something like this:
```
----------------------
Amount     Month
~~~~~~     ~~~~~
50.00      201801
55.50      201802
61.00      201803
66.50      201804
72.00      201805
77.50      201806
83.00      201807
88.50      201808
94.00      201809
99.50      201810
105.00     201811
110.50     201812


12 rows returned
----------------------
```
With this RTable as input, we want to calculate a monthly running total, i.e., an accumulating amount per month. So we want this:
```
--------------------------------------
Amount     AccumAmount     Month
~~~~~~     ~~~~~~~~~~~     ~~~~~
50.00      50.00           201801
55.50      105.50          201802
61.00      166.50          201803
66.50      233.00          201804
72.00      305.00          201805
77.50      382.50          201806
83.00      465.50          201807
88.50      554.00          201808
94.00      648.00          201809
99.50      747.50          201810
105.00     852.50          201811
110.50     963.00          201812


12 rows returned
--------------------------------------
```
How can we do this with Julius?

First of all, one must be able to calculate it with SQL. With SQL we have two options: a) to use analytic functions and b) not to use analytic functions. With option A, the calculation is ridiculously simple. With option B one has to do a self-join (i.e., join the input RTable to a second incarnation of itself), in order to calculate the result, i.e., it is quite more complex. Next, we will show you how simple it is to do it with an analytic function and leave the non-analytic-function option as an exercise to the interested reader :) 
```sql
SELECT	"Amount"
		,sum("Amount") over (order by "Month") "AccumAmount", 
		"Month"
FROM src
```
Now we will proceed to show you how to do it with Julius. In fact, as you will see, we have implemented this with the same "logic" as how analytic functions work. This is how the analytic function above, would process this calculation:
1. Analytic functions are performed on a result set after all join, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses are complete, but before the final `ORDER BY` operation is performed. In our case we have no such operations, so we can apply our analytic function directly on the `src` table
2. Analytic functions are applied per partition defined in the `PARTITION BY` clause, but since we don't have such a clause in our example, we can treat the whole table as a single partition over which the analytic function will be applied. 
3. Next we order our partition based on the `order by` clause, i.e., ascending by month. This will be the *Window* of rows over which, we will apply our aggregate function, namely `sum`.
4. We iterate through our Window of sorted rows and at each iteration we sum all the rows in the range: `RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`, meaning summing all rows from the beginning of the Window till the current row (included). Thus at each iteration we get an accumulated total, our monthly running total.

Here is the etl function that accepts as input the source RTable, with the monthly totals and returns the target RTable with the monthly running totals.
```haskell
myetl :: [RTable] -> [RTable]
myetl [src] = 
	let
		-- tab1 = create new rtable with additional column "AccumAmount" 
		-- initialized with 0.0 and ordered by month
		tab1 = juliusToRTable $ jul1 src
		-- tab2 = find sum from starting RTuple till current RTuple 
		-- (i.e., window that our agg function is applied).
		-- Start with tab1 as accumulator tab
		trg = juliusToRTable $ jul2 tab1
	in [trg]
	where
		jul1 s =	EtlMapStart
					:-> (EtlC $
							Source [] $
							Target ["AccumAmount"] $
							By (\_ -> [RDouble 0.0]) (On $ Tab s) DontRemoveSrc $
							FilterBy (\_ -> True)
						) 
					:-> (EtlR $
							ROpStart
							:.(OrderBy [("Month", Asc)] $ 
								From Previous 
							)
						)
		jul2 initTab = 	EtlMapStart
						:-> (EtlR $
								ROpStart
								-- :.(GenUnaryOp (On $ Tab src) $
								:.(GenUnaryOp (On $ Tab initTab) $
									ByUnaryOp $ rtabFoldl' accumFunc initTab 
								)
								:.(OrderBy [("Month", Asc)] $
									From Previous
								)
							)
		accumFunc =	\accTab rtup ->
			let
				-- find sum from starting RTuple till current RTuple (i.e., window that our agg function is applied)
				runningSum = (headRTup $ currAggTab) <!> "RunningSum"
				currAggTab = juliusToRTable $
								EtlMapStart 
								:-> (EtlR $
										ROpStart
										-- filter rtuples to get current window of rtuples that sum will be applied
										:.	(Filter (From $ Tab accTab) $
												FilterBy (\t -> t <!> "Month" <= rtup <!> "Month")
										)
										-- apply sum on window of rtuples
										:.	(Agg $
												AggOn [Sum "Amount" $ As "RunningSum"] $ From Previous
										)
									)
			in updateRTab	[("AccumAmount", runningSum)] -- update specific month RTuple with accumulated amount
							(\t -> t <!> "Month" == rtup <!> "Month")
							accTab

```
For clearness, we have split our logic into two separate Julius expressions: `jul1` and `jul2`.

`jul1` receives as input the source RTable and returns a new RTable, which is exactly the same as the source but with one additional column ("AccumAmount") initialized to a default value 0.0 and with the RTuples sorted by "Month" in ascending order. This corresponds logically to steps 1 to 3 from above. The new column is added with a column mapping, which is followed by an order by operation.

`jul2` receives as input the output from `jul1` and performs the iteration that we have described in step 4 above, with the use of the folding function, `rtabFoldl'`, which is available in the RTable.Core module of the DBFunctor package (which is exposed also from the Etl.Julius module). 

Essentially we define an accumulating function `accumFunc`, which iterates through the sorted set of RTuples and in each iteration calculates the running total and then updates (`updateRTab`) the input RTable (i.e., the accumulator RTable of the fold). This of course creates a new RTable due to immutability. At the final iteration, we have the update for the last month and we get our result.

Note that the folding operation has been smoothly incorporated in the `jul2` Julius expression as a generic unary operation (`GenUnaryOp` clause).

The main message here is that with a simple fold and the generic unary operation mechanism, we have implemented something which is quite complex. This complexity in SQL is hidden in the implementation of analytic functions, but with functional programming the implementation boils down to a simple fold. So you see how powerful Julius + Haskell  can get and enable you to easily implement any calculation you might need.
<a name="subqueries"></a>
### Subqueries
Subqueries in Julius are similar in concept with SQL subqueries. They are normal Julius expressions within Julius expressions. 

As we have seen, all Julius operations include a `FromRTable` clause (for Relational Operations),  or an `OnRTable` clause (for column mappings), with which we define the RTable over which the current operation will be applied. Their  syntax is repeated here for convenience.
```
<FromRTable>	::=	From <TabExpr>

<OnRTable> ::= On <TabExpr>

<TabExpr>		::=	Tab <RTable> | Previous 	(* Specify the input RTable, or "Previous" if this operation is to be applied to a previous result, generated by the previous operation within the same expression *)
<RTable>		::= RTable
```
In addition, we have seen that for any RTable there can be defined a Julius expression that generates it, when evaluated. Therefore, we can replace the `TabExpr` clause with a call to
`juliusToRTable <julius expression>` function that returns an RTable, after evaluating the input Julius expression.
```haskell
juliusToRTable :: ETLMappingExpr -> RTable
```
Therefore, the Julius expressions that appear in a `FromRTable`, or `OnRTable` clause are the subqueries in the Julius language. Here is very simple example, where the `myJulExpr`  expression is applied on another julius expression (i.e., a subquery)  named `subqExpr`
```haskell
myJulExpr  =  
	EtlMapStart  
	:->  (EtlR  $  
			ROpStart  
			:.  (Filter  (From  $  Tab  $ juliusToRTable subqExpr)  $  
					FilterBy  (\t  ->  <some predicate>  )
		 )
subqExpr = 
	EtlMapStart  
	:->  (<some operation>)
	...
	:-> (<some operation>)
```

<a name="intresults"></a>
### Naming Intermediate Results
As we have seen, a Julius expression is a chain of ETL operations (where each operation is either a relational operation or a column mapping). Each operation accepts as input one or two RTables  (normally the result from the previous operation) and returns a new RTable. So every operation in a Julius expression is an *intermediate result*.
What if we want to refer (i.e., use as input) to one of these intermediate results in a later operation within the same Julius expression? This is possible, because we can provide a name to each such intermediate result and then access it directly with function `takeNamedResult` of the Etl.Julius module.
```haskell
takeNamedResult :: NamedResultName	-> ETLMappingExpr -> ETLMappingExpr	
```
The "SQL equivalent" to this is the so-called `WITH` clause, or *subquery factoring* clause, which is part of the SQL-99 standard. With this clause we can provide a name to each such intermediate result (subquery) and access it in a `FROM` clause as if it was a regular table. This can be used in order to reduce repetition and simplify complex SQL statements.
Lets start with the syntax of a Julius expression with named results:
```
EtlMapStart :=> NamedResult "Result1" <etl operation 1> :=> ... :=> NamedResult "ResultN" <etl operation N>
```
So you see, instead of the `:->` data constructor, now we use the `:=>` constructor accompanied with the `NamedResult` constructor that accepts as parameters a name for the result of the operation and the operation itself.
In order, to access (i.e., reference) a named result, we have to use the `takeNamedResult` function that we have mentioned above.  This function's logic is quite similar to the `take` function that we use in lists in order to access an n-length prefix of the list but instead of providing the length of a sublist, we give the name of the operation/result that we want to access. Lets see an example:
```haskell
etlXpression = 
   EtlMapStart
   :-> (EtlC $ ...)  
   -- "myResult" is a named operation, i.e., a named result 
   :=> NamedResult "myResult" (EtlR $ ...) 
   :-> (EtlR $ ... )
   :-> (EtlR $
		   ROpStart
		   :.  (Minus 
				   (TabL $ 
				   --  THIS IS THE POINT WHERE WE USE THE NAMED RESULT!
					   juliusToRTable $ takeNamedResult "myResult" etlXpression    
				   ) 
				   (Previous))
	   )
```
You can see that "myResult" is the name of the intermediate result up to and including the operation at this point. Later on, within some other operation, we refer to "myResult", which plays the role of the left operand in Minus operation.

## Output
<a name="print"></a>
### Printing Results
Printing the contents of an RTable on screen, in a user-friendly manner, is of course very important. To this end, the RTable.Core module of the DBFunctor package (which is also exported from the Etl.Julius module) includes the "printRTable" family of functions. These provide basically the following capabilities:

 - Printing with no column value formatting options
 - Column-formatted printing "a la printf"
 - Safe printing (formatted or not) in the presence of exceptions

These are the topics of the next paragraphs. 
#### Simple Printing
The most simple method for printing an RTable on screen is the `printRTable` function:
```haskell
printRTable :: RTable -> IO ()
```
You just give as input an RTable and you get it printed on screen. So simple.

For example, here is the output from our [montlhy running total](#rtotal) example:
```
--------------------------------------

We have printed the result on screen with the use of the `printRTable` function, like this:

```haskell
main :: IO()
main = do 
	-- run etl
	[trg] <- runETL myetl [src]
	-- print target
	printRTable trg
```
Please note that this function does not give you the option to modify how the values of each column will appear (i.e., the formatting). Also with this function you cannot define the column order on screen (i.e., which column is printed first, which second , etc.). It is plain vanilla printing based on some default formatting options.
#### Formatted Printing
Enter the world of formatted printing! The RTable.Core module of the DBFunctor package (which is also exported from the Etl.Julius module) provides the `printfRTable` function, which is a "printf for RTables". It can be used instead of `printRTable`, when one of the following two is required:
 - When we want to specify the order that the columns will be printed on screen 
  - When we want to specify the formatting of the values by using
   a "printf-like" format specifier (`FormatSpecifier`)

Here is the signature:
```haskell
printfRTable :: RTupleFormat -> RTable -> IO()
```
In order to use this function, one has to provide the RTable to be printed along with an  RTuple formatting specification (`RTupleFormat`). This data type includes both of the formatting specifications mentioned above. To create such a data type we can use the `genRTupleFormat` function:
```haskell
genRTupleFormat :: [ColumnName]	-> ColFormatMap	-> RTupleFormat
```
The first argument (`[ColumnName]`) is a list of column names, which defines the order by which the input RTable's columns will be printed on screen. The second argument is a mapping (`ColFormatMap`) between a specific column and a format specification for the values of this column. The column is provided by `ColumnName` and the format specification for the values is essentially a String with "[printf](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.10.1.0/docs/Text-Printf.html)-like" format specifiers.
In order to create such a mapping one has to use function `genColFormatMap`.
```haskell
genColFormatMap :: [(ColumnName, FormatSpecifier)] -> ColFormatMap
``` 
where
```haskell
data FormatSpecifier = DefaultFormat | Format String
```
is the formatting specification string that "works" like [printf](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.10.1.0/docs/Text-Printf.html). Lets see it in actions with a specific example.
Returning to our previous example with the running total, assume that we want to impose the following printing order on the columns: Month, Amount, AccumAmount.
And, assume also that we want to apply the following formatting rules:

 - "Month": display only the first 4 characters (i.e., the year) and enclose within "< >"  (`Format "< %.4s >"`)
 - "Amount": display in scientific notation with a single digit after the decimal point, left aligned in a total space of 20 characters (`Format "%-20.1e"`).
 - "AccumAmount": Display 4 digits after the decimal point (`Format "%.4f"`)

Here is the call to `printfRTable` that achieves the above formatting:
```haskell
-- print formatted
	printfRTable 	(genRTupleFormat 
						["Month", "Amount", "AccumAmount"] $ -- specify column printing order
						genColFormatMap [("Month", Format "< %.4s >"), ("Amount", Format "%-20.1e"), ("AccumAmount", Format "%.4f")]
					) 
					trg
```
And here is the output.
```
--------------------------------------
Month      Amount     AccumAmount

#### Safe Printing
 We have seen functions `printRTable` and `printfRTable` for printing and formatted printing of an RTable respectively. However, in real life things don't always work out smoothly and thus, within an IO Monad, an exception might be thrown.  Typically, an exception will be thrown while we are evaluating a Julius expression in order to create the resulting RTable.

In order to handle this case gracefully the RTable.Core module provides two"safe"  alternatives for printing an RTable, namely functions: eitherPrintRTable and eitherPrintfRTable. These functions return an Either data type, so as to give the ability to handle exceptions gracefully, during the evaluation of the input RTable. The signature of these functions follows next.
```haskell
eitherPrintRTable :: Exception e 
	=> (RTable -> IO ()) 
	-> RTable 
	-> IO (Either e ())

eitherPrintfRTable :: Exception e 
	=> (RTupleFormat -> RTable -> IO ()) 
	-> RTupleFormat 
	-> RTable 
	-> IO (Either e ())
```
The first argument of these functions are the printRTable and printfRTable functions respectively. Then, we provide the parameters that each one of these two functions require.
Here is a short example:
```haskell
do 
 p <- (eitherPrintRTable	printRTable $
							juliusToRTable $ <a Julius expression>                                 
      ) :: IO (Either SomeException ())
 case p of
           Left exc -> putStrLn $ "There was an error in the Julius evaluation: " ++ (show exc)
           Right _  -> return ()
```
 We see that we call function `juliusToRTable`, in order to evaluate a Julius expression into an RTable. If from this evaluation some problem comes up, then an exception will be thrown and will be delivered in the `Left` part of the returned `Either` data type, giving us the chance to handle it gracefully.

### Output Result to CSV file
The most common method to make your result RTable persistent is of course to save itnot a csv file. If you remember from the [Julius DDL: Creating an RTable from a CSV file](#ddl) section, the RTable.Data.CSV module exposes a `CSV` data type, which is an instance of the `RTabular` type class and thus it implements functions `toRTable` and `fromRTable`, in order to convert from/to a data type `a` to/from an RTable. 

The signature of the `fromRTable` function is the following:
```haskell
fromRTable :: (RTabular a) => RTableMData -> RTable -> a
```
So, as long as you can provide the appropriate RTable metadata (i.e., the RTable column names and their respective data types), the conversion of an RTable to a target data type (e.g., `CSV`), is very simple. Going back to the example in section  [Julius DDL: Creating an RTable from a CSV file](#ddl), we can see in step 5, how we can store the result RTable into csv file "myresults.csv".
```haskell
import     Etl.Julius
import     RTable.Data.CSV     (CSV, readCSV, writeCSV, toRTable)

main:: IO()
main = do
	-- 1. Read the csv file
	mycsv <- readCSV "mydata.csv"

	-- 3. Transform CSV data type into an RTable data type
	let myRTable = toRTable rtabMdata mycsv

	-- 4. Do stuff with your new RTable
	resultRTab <- runJulius $ myJulExpression myRTable

	-- 5. Write result into a csv file
	writeCSV  "myresults.csv"  $  fromRTable  resultRTabMData  resultRTab 
		
	where
		-- 2. Define the structure of the RTable
		rtabMData :: RTableMData
		rtabMData = createRTableMData (
			"myTab"  -- table name
			,[	("OWNER", Varchar)				-- Owner of the table
				,("TABLE_NAME", Varchar)		-- Name of the table
				,("TABLESPACE_NAME", Varchar)	-- Tablespace name
				,("STATUS",Varchar)				-- Status of the table object (VALID/IVALID)
				,("NUM_ROWS", Integer)			-- Number of rows in the table
				,("BLOCKS", Integer)			-- Number of Blocks allocated for this table
				,("LAST_ANALYZED", Timestamp "MM_DD_YYYY HH24:MI:SS")	-- Timestamp of the last time the table was analyzed (i.e., gathered statistics)
			]
		)
			["OWNER", "TABLE_NAME"] -- primary key
			[]	-- (alternative) unique keys
		
		-- Define result RTable metadata
		resultRTabMData :: RTableMData
		resultRTabMData = ...

		-- Define a Julius expression for the processing of the input data
		myJulExpression :: RTable -> ETLMappingExpr
		myJulExpression = ...
		
```
